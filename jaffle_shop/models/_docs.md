# The Ubiquitous Jaffle Shop ðŸ¥ª

The "Jaffle Shop" is a fictional e-commerce store used by [dbt-labs](https://github.com/dbt-labs) to demonstrate the capabilities of [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).

This repo is a fork of [the dbt-labs version](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) for showing off some Sainsbury's extensions.

## What makes this project âœ¨specialâœ¨?

This uses [a custom (forked) package](https://github.com/Bilbottom/dbt-unit-testing) for extended unit testing.
